# 🔧 Requirements

## Supported Operating Systems

* Parrot OS (recommended)
* Debian 11+ / Ubuntu 20.04+
* Linux Mint 20+
* Any Debian-based distribution

## Hardware Requirements

* At least 5GB of free disk space
* Active internet connection
* 64-bit processor (amd64)

## Permissions

* User with sudo privileges
* Do not run as root

---

# 🚀 Installation and Usage

## Method 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-user/EasyLinux.git

# Enter the project directory
cd EasyLinux

# Make the installer executable
chmod +x install.sh

# Run the installer
./install.sh
```

---

# ⚡ Running with Profiles and Flags

```bash
# Install everything without category menus
./install.sh --all

# Developer profile
./install.sh --developer

# Custom declarative profile
./install.sh --profile developer

# Desktop profile
./install.sh --desktop

# Non-interactive confirmation mode
./install.sh --developer --yes

# Skip initial apt update
./install.sh --no-update
```

> Note: the old "one-liner" direct download method is no longer recommended because the installer now uses multiple modules and configuration files.

### Method 2: Downloadable single file

Every CI run creates an artifact named `easylinux-single-file`. Releases created from a `v*` tag also include an `EasyLinux` file that can be downloaded from GitHub Releases.

```bash
chmod +x EasyLinux
./EasyLinux --developer --yes
```

The file is a self-extracting launcher containing the installer, modules, and profiles. It extracts them into a temporary directory and runs the same `install.sh`. It requires Bash, `tar`, `base64`, an internet connection, and sudo on a Debian-based distribution.

To build it locally:

```bash
bash tools/build-single-file.sh
./dist/EasyLinux --help
```

---

# 🧩 Declarative Profiles

Profiles are stored inside:

```text
config/profiles/*.conf
```

and executed in declarative steps.

Example profile:

```bash
PROFILE_DESCRIPTION="Full development stack"

PROFILE_CATALOGS=(
   terminal-base
   development-base
)

PROFILE_STEPS=(
   install_vscode
   install_java
)

PROFILE_APT_PACKAGES=(
   shellcheck
)

PROFILE_FLATPAK_APPS=(
   "com.github.tchx84.Flatseal|Flatseal"
)

PROFILE_VSCODE_EXTENSIONS=(
   "ms-python.python|Python"
)
```

You can create your own profile, for example:

```text
config/profiles/custom.conf
```

and run it with:

```bash
./install.sh --profile custom
```

# 🛠️ Troubleshooting

## Script Has No Execute Permissions

```bash
chmod +x install.sh
```

---

## Sudo Permission Errors

Make sure your user belongs to the sudo group:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG sudo $USER
# Log out and back in
```

---

## Internet Connection Error

Check connectivity:

```bash
curl -Is https://deb.debian.org
```

---

## Flatpak Not Installed

The installer can automatically install Flatpak, but you can also install it manually:

```bash
sudo apt install flatpak

flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub \
https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
```

---

## View Installation Logs

Logs are stored in:

```text
~/.easylinux/logs/
```

Useful commands:

```bash
# Show latest log
ls -lt ~/.easylinux/logs/ | head -n 2

# Read a specific log
cat ~/.easylinux/logs/install_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log

# Show recent errors
grep ERROR ~/.easylinux/logs/install_*.log | tail -n 20
```

---

## An Application Failed to Install

1. Review the corresponding log
2. Try installing manually:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install package-name
```

3. Verify repositories are configured correctly

---

## System Fails to Update

```bash
# Clean apt cache
sudo apt clean
sudo apt autoclean

# Refresh package lists
sudo apt update

# Full upgrade
sudo apt full-upgrade
```

---

# 🍷 Wine Troubleshooting

## Wine Does Not Install Correctly

```bash
# Check 32-bit architecture support
dpkg --print-foreign-architectures

# If i386 is missing:
sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
sudo apt update

# Reinstall Wine
sudo apt install --reinstall wine wine32 wine64
```

---

## A Windows Application Does Not Work

1. **Check compatibility**

   * [https://appdb.winehq.org/](https://appdb.winehq.org/)

2. **Install dependencies with Winetricks**

```bash
winetricks
```

3. **Use PlayOnLinux**

   * Easier Wine version management
   * Better support for complex applications

4. **Look for native alternatives**

   * Native Linux applications are always preferred

---

## Fully Remove Wine

```bash
sudo apt remove --purge wine wine32 wine64 winetricks playonlinux

sudo apt autoremove

rm -rf ~/.wine
rm -rf ~/.PlayOnLinux
```
